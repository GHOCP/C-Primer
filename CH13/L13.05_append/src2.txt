 causes other
files to be recognized as the standard input or standard output. The purpose of the standard
error output file is to provide a logically distinct place to send error messages. If, for example,
you use redirection to send output to a file instead of to the screen, output sent to the standard
error output still goes to the screen. This is good because if the error messages were routed to
the file, you would not see them until you viewed the file.
